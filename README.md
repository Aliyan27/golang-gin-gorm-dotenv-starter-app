# Go Lang Gin Starter App

This repository contains a starter app built using the following technologies:
- [Gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin): A web framework written in Go (Golang).
- [GORM](https://gorm.io/): The fantastic ORM library for Golang.
- [dotenv](https://github.com/joho/godotenv): A Go port of the Ruby dotenv library, which loads environment variables from a `.env` file.
- [Air](https://github.com/cosmtrek/air): Live reload for Go apps.

## Features
- **Gin**: Fast, minimalistic web framework for building Go applications.
- **GORM**: ORM library for database interaction.
- **Dotenv**: Manage environment variables efficiently.
- **Air**: Hot reloading for development.
